**iNTERvIEVER**

I'll be building an app that will gather interview opportunities from many other websites into one place, and allow users to browse through them with ease. With a press of a button, users will be redirected to the source website of the job posting and be allowed to apply for the job. **Welcome to iNTERvIEVER!**

**Color Decisions**

I decided to use the blue color as the base color pallete for my website. I'm keeping the colors simple - blue and white.

Of course, I'm using different shaders of the mentioned colors; specifically for "Featured Jobs" section, to keep things fresh and not too simple.

All in all, I've kept a very simple color choices, and if I were to upgrade them, I'd only add some effects to them and use some darker/brighter variations.

**Design Decisions**

Navigation Bar

Design idea is simple - we have a navigation bar at the top whose whole purpose is to serve as a Search Filter. Users can search for job offerings by searching for:
- Keywords (aka job titles),
- Locations (ie where the work placement is located),
- Or both.

Below the navigation bar is the main area of the website, and that would be the "Featured Jobs" section. Here is where the jobs that have or have not been filtered will appear. The background is a simple light grey color.

Featured Jobs

This section contains the Job Offers. Each job is presented in a simple  way, with an accent on the readability and simplicity. 

It contains basic information such as:
- Position name
- Comapny name
- Location
- Job Description
- Apply Button

The apply button will take users to that company's page for that specific job application they selected, where they can see more detailed information regarding the position.

**Summary**

The design idea and color choices are very simple, as I wanted to put an accent on readability, functionality and an ease of use. The company logos are shown for both easier recognition by the users, as well as to enrich the website with images.
